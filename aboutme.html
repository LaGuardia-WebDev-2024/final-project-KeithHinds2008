          Keith Hinds is a dynamic and versatile dancer, choreographer, and
          artist based in New York City. Currently attending Fiorello H.
          LaGuardia High School, Keith has demonstrated an exceptional range of
          skills across a wide array of dance genres. With training in
          everything from Contemporary, Ballet, and Hip Hop to Tap, Jazz, Vogue,
          West-African, and Modern, Keith is known for his ability to seamlessly
          blend multiple styles, showcasing his adaptability and creativity as a
          performer. His extensive training has earned him accolades such as
          being a 2024 YoungArts Winner in Modern/Contemporary Dance and
          receiving the Nuestro Futuro Award from Ballet Hispanico in 2023.
          Keith is also a dedicated student at MOVE|NYC’s Young Professionals
          Program, has done the Alvin Ailey Summer Intensive, trained at Ballet
          Hispanico, and the Juilliard Summer Intensive for 2 years in a row,
          where he further hones his craft under the mentorship of renowned
          figures in the dance world.
        </p>

        <p class="si">
          Keith’s professional experience spans major performances and events,
          including his recent role as a choreographer at Dance Lab New York's
          NextGen program, a dancer at the 2025 Dance Lab New York Honoree Gala
          and alongside Bishop Briggs in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade for
          Netflix’s Wednesday float. His stage presence has also graced venues
          such as the New York City Center for Dance Against Cancer and Radio
          City Music Hall, where him and his fellow young professionals from
          <strong>MOVE|NYC|</strong> opened the Christmas Spectacular for the

        </p>
        <p class="si">
          As a choreographer, Keith approaches movement as a powerful vessel for
          storytelling. His work explores the complexity of the human
          experience, striving to depict humanity in all its beauty,
          vulnerability, and resilience. Keith believes that true art emerges
          when we share stories that resonate—whether intimately personal or
          universally felt. Through choreography, he invites audiences not just
          to witness a performance, but to experience it with him, creating
          space for empathy, connection, and reflection.

          <br /><br />His choreographic voice has been featured in Dance Lab
          NY’s NextGen Apprenticeship and Residency, as well as his original
          work <em> Hesitant Harmony</em> perfromed at LaGuardia High School's
          <em>Rising Stars</em> and MOVE|NYC|'s Winter Intensive showcase. With
          a deep-rooted commitment to authenticity and expression, Keith
          continues to evolve as both a performer and a maker, using dance to
          build bridges between people, stories, and worlds. Keith’s commitment
          to his craft, coupled with his versatility across diverse dance
          styles, sets him apart as a rising star in the dance world. With a
          passion for pushing boundaries and a deep dedication to both
          performance and creation, Keith is poised to make a significant impact
          in the industry.
